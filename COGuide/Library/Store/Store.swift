 A store represents a container for data that faciliates the following
 
 - Making changes through actions:
    You are required to define the `Action` type used by the store for actions.
    To update the store, you call the `.publish` method and provide an instance of the action
 
 - Single point of mutation:
    You are required to supply the method that reduces the store from one state to another.
    You're given action that was taken, and the previous value of the store.
    Return whatever the new state of the store is like given that information.
 
 - Observing any changes:
    Anytime something in a store changes, it notifies all observers with its old value and new value


 ##Example:##
 ```
 public class User {}
 public class Deal {}
 
 public struct DealStore {
 
    var deals: [Deal]
    var currentlySelectedDeal: Deal?
 
    init(deals: [Deal] = [], currentlySelectedDeal: Deal? = nil) {
        self.deals = deals
        self.currentlySelectedDeal = currentlySelectedDeal
    }
 }
 
 extension DealState: Reducible {
 
    public typealias Action = DealAction
 
    public enum DealAction {
 
        // if we're going to refresh the deals, we'll need to supply the new deals to refresh it with
        case refresh(deals: [Deal])
 
        // if we're going to add a new deal, then we'll need to supply whatever deal we're adding
        case add(deal: Deal)
 
        // to delete a deal, we just need a way to identify which deal to delete
        case delete(id: Int)
 
        // to select a deal, we just need a way to identify which deal to select
        case select(id: Int)
    }
 
     public mutating func reduced(by action: Action, from oldValue: DealState) -> DealState {
 
         // first we need a local mutable copy of the store
         var updatedStore = oldValue
 
         // Now we will switch across the type of action that we defined to figure out what we need to do to the store
         switch action {
 
         case .refresh(let deals):
            // Since we're refreshing the store's deals, we'll just replace the entire array of deals with new array of deals
            updatedStore.deals = deals
 
            // Since we replaced all the deals, it's possible that we no longer have the deal that was selected
            // Let's update the value for the currently selected deal as well to point the matching deal, otherwise set to nil
            guard let previouslySelectedStore = updatedStore.currentlySelectedDeal,

         case .add(let deal):
            // We just need to add a deal to the end of the deal list here.
            updatedStore.deals.append(deal)
 
         case .delete(let dealId):
            // update the deal list to remove the deal from the list if present
            updatedStore.deals = updatedStore.deals.filter { return $0.id != dealId }
 
            // we also want to update the currentlySelectedDeal if the deal we removed was that deal
            guard updatedStore.currentlySelectedDeal?.id == dealId else { return }

            updatedStore.currentlySelectedDeal = updatedStore.deals.first(where: { $0.id == id })
        }
 
        // Now that we've updated the store to reflect the new values we want, we return the new value for the store.
        // The new value will replace the old one, and observers will be notified and passed the updated value.
