/**
  By adopting this protocol, You are agreeing to become an observable entity
 
  - You can subscribe to an Observable in order to receive updates when its value changes
  - You can unsubscribe from an Observable in order to no longer receive updates on change
  - You can receive updates via a perform method with an Action type you define
    that updates the value being obseved (if updating that value is applicable)
  - Observables internally manages its observers. A default implementation is provided for this

  What sort of situations would I want to use this for?
  - When you have something that needs to be monitored/watched.
    Generally because that value changing may result in side effects or triggers elsewhere
  - When you need to keep entities in sync with one another
  - When you need to process realtime data/messages that could happen at any point

  ##In order to conform to this protocol, you just have to tell me three things##
  1. The Element:
        What entity Type is being observed
  2. The Action:
        What entity Type can be sent to you (the entity conforming to Observable)
        in order be updated and subsequently notify all observers
  3. The Update method:
        This is the only required method to implement. The _ONLY_ thing you need to do
        here is to update the `value` property to whatever it should be set to after
        this method is called.

  ##Example:##
  ```
  // I have this manager that has messages. I now want to be able to publish updates to messages and for others to be notified when those changes happen
  public struct MessageManager: Observable {
 
      // I want to observe the contents of this
      public struct Contents {
          public var message: String?
      }
 
      // This is the action I want to update messages with
      public enum MessageUpdate {
          case newMessage(text: String)
          case clear
      }
 
      // This is the eneity type I want to observe
      public typealias Element = MessageManager.Contents?
 
      // This is the type I want to receive in order to update the value of the entity being observed
      public typealias Action = MessageManager.MessageUpdate
 
      public var value: Element
      public var observers: [String: ObserverWrapper<Element>] = [:]
 
      // this is the update method required.
      // All I have to do here is make sure I return the new value for the entity being obseved
      // anytime this method is called. It's called with one of the Actions that were defined
      // So I can inspect that action here, make whatever decisions I want to make to modify
      // the entity being observed, and then I return that entity
      // After this method is executed, the observers will be notified automatically
      public mutating func update(with action: Action, from oldValue: Element) -> Element {
 
          // I don't want to manually change the self.value property, that's managed for me
          // when I return the updated value from this method. So instead, make a copy
          // of the oldValue here and update it based on the value of the Action passed in
          // then return the new value
          var newValue = oldValue
          switch action {
          case .newMessage(let message): newValue?.message = message
          case .clear: newValue?.message = nil
          }
          return newValue
      }
  }
 ```
